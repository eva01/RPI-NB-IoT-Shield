# RPI-NB-IoT-Shield
This is the repository of sixfab raspberry pi nb-iot shield.

# Product Description
It is a narrow band IoT (Nb-IoT) shield for Raspberry Pi. NB-IOT is very suitable for IoT applications with low power consumption. Shield also has the built-in 3-axis accelerometer, temperature, humidity, light sensors, optocoupler, and relay. If you like, you can also add your own sensors using the built-in 4 channel ADC.

# Detailed Features
* LTE BC95 Nb-IoT Module B20 800MHz 
* ADS1015 12 Bit 4 Channel ADC
* Relay with optocoupler protection (24V DC, 120-220V AC Switching)
* Optocoupler (3-12 V DC switching)- Built-in 3 axis accelerometer (MMA8452Q)
* Built-In HDC1080 temperature sensor (-40 +125 C)
* Built-In HDC1080 humidity sensor (0 100%)
* Built-In ALS-PT19 ambient light sensor()
* 1-Wire interface (3 male pins)(It can be used with DS18B20, DHT21 etc.)
* I2C interface (4 male pins)
* User button and LED
* Micro SIM Socket
* Built-in PCB Antenna
* UFL socket for external antenna

# Attention
! All data pins work with 3.3V reference. Any other voltage level should harm your shield or RPI.
